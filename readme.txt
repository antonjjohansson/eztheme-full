EZTheme - By Anton Johansson

General information
==================================================================================================

EZTheme, is my first ever created subreddit theme, made from
the bottom up, with some use of external references, I am happy
so far, and I think it's time for me to release my first build of
the theme, I will keep on updating it to look nice, and fix it
and make it more navigateable. I do listen to feedback, so anything
is good.

Edit all images if you want, make sure to upload all the pictures inside of the /images folder,
otherwise the theme wont work.

Customize the code
==================================================================================================

I have commented the code a lot, so it should be easily read, if you know basic CSS then you can
easily read it. If the font doesn't suit you, it's changeable under the "body" code, in the
"font-family".
