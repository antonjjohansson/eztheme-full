EZTheme 1.1

Big Changes:

- New Background choices. (Change the repeatbackground image to add a custom background).
- Customize name of Readers, Currently Online and moderator. (Can be found at the bottom of the code).

Minor changes:

- Nav menu lowered.
- Added so now /r/EZTheme text is shown in the header. (You can custom the text under Header Text, near the top of code).
- Removed the default Reddit Header Icon. (Might change in the future, so it's replaceable by a custom picture).
- Added a border and box shadow to the whole side box.
- Changed the font from "Pixel Emulator" to "Candara". (You can change the font under the Body code).
